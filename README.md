## Project Description
Canary is a learning platform that makes virtual learning environments that engage students through movement. Teachers on the platform can pose questions to the classroom and students can select their answers simply through their gestures. We use tensorflow pose recognition to detect these gestures and socket.io to create classroom environments.
